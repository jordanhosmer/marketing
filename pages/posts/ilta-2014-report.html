Fast Future Research has released its report on future strategies for lawyers in an increasingly "techno-centric" world.  
 
The report highlights that in the face of increasingly powerful and global economic and technological forces, client expectations of law firms will evolve rapidly with a particular emphasis on four key themes:<br /><br />
1. _The Client is the Priority_ - Firms must adopt a truly client-centric approach - focusing strategy, effort and investment on securing and enhancing customer relationships.<br /><br />
2. _Leveraging Lawyers_ - Taking advantage of innovative collaboration tools, mobile solutions and increasingly intelligent systems to enhance the productivity, strategic insight and impact of professional staff.<br /><br />
3. _Re-Engineering Processes_ - Applying rigorous project management to matter execution, eliminating wasteful activity, streamlining processes and automating workflows.<br /><br /> 
4. _Innovate to Differentiate_ - Using IT to generate and support client-focused innovation.<br /><br />
Key findings from the report highlight that:<br /><br />
- _91%_ of respondants expect the transparency of the legal process to increase as a result of client demands.<br /><br />
- _73%_ of respondants agree or strongly agree that the capacity for rapid IT-enabled innovation will be a critical differentiator for law firms in the future.<br /><br />
- _77%_ of respondants agree to some extent that technology firms will increasingly enter the legal industry, using disruptive innovations to provide direct legal service delivery.<br /><br />
 The report is the culmination of a year-long study undertaken for the International Legal Technology Association (ILTA).<br /><br />
