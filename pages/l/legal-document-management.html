    <p>
      I once described the practice of law as "standing under Niagara Fall with a shot glass and being asked to fill it exactly half way."  Managing the flood of documents that has come to characterize legal work is a nearly impossible task. Imagine a world where you could stop wasting your time looking for documents and focus on what really matters. No, it does not require you quit law and pursue your dream of becoming a yoga instructor.  You can get organized and save yourself time and aggravation by adopting a simple and easy-to-use document management system.  
    </p>
    <h3>Save Time and Increase Your Bottom Line</h3>
    <p>
      The International Data Corporation estimates that employees spend 20% of their day looking for information and only finding what they need 50% of the time.  A document management system helps you reclaim misspent time which is is better used for:
    </p>
    <ul class="">
      <li>meeting with clients and closing deals.</li>
      <li>responding more quickly to client queries.</li>
      <li>providing quality customer service, which ultimately leads to more business.</li>
    </ul>

     <h3>Increase Productivity and Efficiency</h3>
     <p>
      Give everyone immediate access to information that allows them to make better, faster decisions - dramatically increasing productivity while accelerating the pace of work.
      </p>
      <p>Document management can help your firm increase productivity and efficiency with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>streamlined document distribution</li>
        <li>reduced avoidable errors</li>
        <li>minimizing lost documents</li>
        <li>creating copies and distributing documents as simply as sending an email.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3>Increase Communication and Collaboration</h3>

      <p>Document management systems make it easy to share documents electronically with colleagues and clients whether youâ€™re at the office or on a mobile device. A quality document management system can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>be accessed remotely or online, allowing documents to be viewed and searched from any internet capable device, without installing additional software</li>
        <li>balance accessibility with security, assisting you in retaining strict control over which documents while making them available to staff and the general public</li>
        <li>be accessed on a wide variety of internet browsers, smartphones and tablets and operating systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Enable Automation</h3>

      <p>Every day, information is used, moved and archived. The manual process of searching, copying and sharing documents is tedious and time-consuming, and the 
      inefficiencies of this process steal precious time from your core business.  Document management solutions with an automated workflow solutions give you the power to recapture lost hours, reduce your overhead expenses and increase profitability, all while improving the level of  service you provide to your clients. 
      </p>

      A workflow solution allows your organization to:
      Streamline document-handling procedures.
      Automatically notify your team when certain events take place.
      Monitor user activity, guaranteeing efficiency and project completion.

            <p class="lead">Nearly 75% of all malpractice suits against lawyers are because someone dropped the ball: planning errors, losing documents and other avoidable mistakes. Lawyers need a strategy for making sure that no one drops the ball.  The answer is ridiculously simple - it begins with a checklist. <p>
