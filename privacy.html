Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personal information while on our Site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our Site, the user would not have to log in using a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our Service. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our Site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site.</p>
