      <p>These Terms are binding on any use of the Service and apply to you from the time that LawPal provides you with access to the Service.&nbsp; You cannot use the Website or the Service, if you do not agree to all of these Terms.</p>

THESE EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, OR LEGAL MALPRACTICE OR NEGLIGENCE OF ATTORNEYS UTILIZED THROUGH USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF WE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH SAYS "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”</li>
         <li>If you suffer loss or damage as a result of LawPal’s negligence or failure to comply with these Terms, any claim by you against LawPal arising from LawPal’s negligence or failure will be limited in respect of any one incident, or series of connected incidents, to the greater of (i) the Access Fees paid by you in the previous three (3) months or (ii) $100.</li>
         <li>If you are not satisfied with the Service, your sole and exclusive remedy is to terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 8 of these Terms.</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">8. TERMINATION</span></p>
      <ol>
         <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Trial policy:</span> When you first sign up for access to the Services you can evaluate the Services under the defined trial usage conditions, with no obligation to continue to use the Services.

If you choose not to continue using the Services, you may delete your organization in the ‘My LawPal’ section of the Services.</li>
         <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">No-fault termination:</span> These Terms will continue for the period covered by the Access Fee paid or payable under Section 3. At the end of each billing period these Terms will automatically continue for another period of the same duration as that period, provided you continue to pay the prescribed Access Fee when due, unless either party terminates these Terms by giving notice to the other party at least seven (7) days before the end of the relevant payment period. If you terminate these Terms you shall be liable to pay all relevant Access Fees on a pro-rata basis for each day of the then current period up to and including the day of termination of these Terms.</li>
         <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Breach:</span> If you:
           <ol>
              <li>Breach any of these Terms (including, without limitation, by non-payment of any Access Fees) and do not remedy the breach within 14 days after receiving notice of the breach if the breach is capable of being remedied;</li>
              <li>Breach any of these Terms and the breach is not capable of being remedied (which includes (without limitation) any breach of Section 3 or any payment of Access Fees that are more than thirty (30) days overdue); or</li>
              <li>You or your business become insolvent or your business goes into liquidation or has a receiver or manager appointed of any of its assets or if you become insolvent, or make any arrangement with your creditors, or become subject to any similar insolvency event in any jurisdiction,</li>
           </ol>
           <span>LawPal may take any or all of the following actions, at its sole discretion:</span></li>
           <ol>
              <li>Terminate this Agreement and your use of the Services and the Website;</li>
              <li>Suspend for any definite or indefinite period of time, your use of the Services and the Website;</li>
              <li>Suspend or terminate access to all or any Data.</li>
              <li>Take either of the actions in sub-clauses (I), (II) and (III) immediately above of this Section 8(D) in respect of any or all other persons whom you have authorized to have access to your information or Data.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if payment of any invoice for Access Fees due is not made in full by the relevant due date, LawPal may: suspend or terminate your use of the Service, the authority for all or any of your Organizations to use the Service, or your rights of access to all or any Data; provided that you shall have access to your Data for thirty (30) days following the date such suspension or termination of the Service.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Accrued Rights:</strong> Termination of these Terms is without prejudice to any rights and obligations of the parties accrued up to and including the date of termination. On termination of this Agreement you will:</li>
            <ol>
               <li>remain liable for any accrued charges and amounts which become due for payment before or after termination; and</li>
               <li>immediately cease to use the Services and the Website.</li>
            </ol>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expiry or termination:</span> Sections 3(A), 3(G), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.<br></li>
      </ol>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">9. HELP DESK</span></strong>
      <ol>

         <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Service Availability:</span> While LawPal intends that the Service should be available twenty four (24) hours a day, seven days a week, it is possible that on occasions the Service or Website may be unavailable to permit maintenance or other development activity to take place.

         <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Severability:</span> If any part or provision of these Terms is invalid, unenforceable or in conflict with the law, that part or provision is replaced with a provision which, as far as possible, accomplishes the original purpose of that part or provision.
