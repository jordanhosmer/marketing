**I recently posted that lawyers and clients should use the engagement letter to foster a "team" approach to legal work.  Some of you asked what an engagement letter like this might look like, so I put something together to get conversation started.**

Re:      Letter of Engagement for [__________].  (the “Company”)


Dear [____________]:


We are grateful that  [___________] (“we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Firm”) will have the opportunity to provide legal services to the Company. We will strive at all times to provide you with the highest quality of professional representation and to work efficiently and cost-effectively, to earn your continued business. We recognize that legal services are expensive and it is our responsibility to ensure that you receive good value for the money you spend. In our view, the best way to achieve both timely and fair payment and good value is to manage every matter closely, emphasizing communication and shared responsibility. 

We look forward to working in partnership with you. Together, we can provide excellent legal work that meets your needs and that adds value both to you and our Firm.  To achieve this goal, we will make every effort to understand the issues behind your legal project and the financial impact of those issues. We will not simply do things “the way it has always been done”, but instead will evaluate what is appropriate for your particular matter.<br /><br />

1. **Scope of Work**<br />
We have agreed to preform the legal services described on Exhibit A . It is further understood that you may, but need not, ask us to perform other legal services now or in the future.  If we agree to perform such other services, then, unless a separate engagement letter has been entered into with respect to such other services, it is understood that such services will be performed according to the terms of this engagement letter.<br /><br />

2. **Identity of Client**<br />
The Firm represents the Company only and not any of its affiliates, owners, or agents, or any of the individuals associated with the Company.  By reason of this representation, the Firm does not represent you in your individual capacity or any of the Company’s parents, subsidiaries, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, or founders, or commonly owned corporations, partnerships or other entities.  Moreover, you acknowledge that we may be unable or unwilling to represent you individually (due to a conflict of interest or for other reasons) once we have begun our representation of the Company, and you consent to our representation of the Company despite this possibility. <br /><br />  

3. **Confidentiality**<br />
	Generally, it is in the Company’s best interests to preserve the confidentiality of all communications between this Firm and the Company.  If the Company discloses these communications, it jeopardizes the privileged nature of the communications, so we advise the Company not to disclose privileged information to third parties.<br />  
	Our duty to protect the Company’s confidential information and the attorney-client privilege will belong to (and may be waived by) the Company alone.  Consequently, we may be obligated to disclose to the Company’s management (to the extent the Company’s management is someone other than you) information you have revealed to us that the Company may benefit from knowing, even if such disclosure is personally detrimental to you.  <br /><br />

4. **Professional Fees and Costs**<br />
	a. **Our Commitment**<br />
	Work performed by attorneys, paralegals, and other professionals of the Firm will be billed at hourly rates currently ranging from $______ to $______ per hour, billed in increments of [_______] of an hour.  Our rates are subject to adjustment from time to time with prior notice, typically on an annual basis.  Due to the changing nature of the law and the uniqueness of the facts of each matter, it is impossible for us to state with certainty how much time a given matter will take; we will nonetheless do our best to provide you with useful estimates before we begin and as work on your matter progresses.

	We will advise you in advance (and receive your consent) of the name, background and hourly rate of each lawyer and paralegal whom we intend to involve in your work. We understand that it is not acceptable to charge you for any professional who has not been approved by you. If a name appears on an invoice and you have not approved that person’s assignment to the matter, you will not be obligated to pay for that person’s time.

	We will not assign work that is appropriate for paralegals to lawyers, or work that is appropriate for secretarial staff to paralegals. For example, filing, copying and assembling documents are secretarial tasks that are part of our overhead. You will not be obligated to pay for work done at an inappropriate rate. If a paralegal’s or lawyer’s participation in a matter, or in a particular meeting, is more for the Firm’s training purposes than for your benefit, you will not be billed for that time.  You will not be obligated to pay for legal fees or expenses related to work or activities that do not comply with these rules and policies. The Firm is responsible for ensuring that every professional who does work for us complies with these rules and policies.

	[Note: This letter assumes that you are billing at an hourly rate.  Of course, if you agree to charge a flat fee for the work, it is much easier and you might simply say: “We have agreed to charge you a flat fee of $_________ for the legal services described on Exhibit A, subject to such work not requiring protracted negotiations and also subject to your prompt cooperation and accurate provision of necessary information throughout the process.”]<br />

	b. **Your Commitment**<br />
	Just like you, the health of our business depends on receiving timely payment for our services. Payment of our statements is due promptly upon receipt. Our rates are based on our receiving payment within thirty (30) days; provided, however, we acknowledge that we may agree to delay requesting payment until the completion of a particular transaction.  The final invoice will be discounted by 10% for invoices paid in full within 21 days of transmittal. 

	You can help us manage our time efficiently and keep costs down by taking care to provide us with all facts relevant to your matter and by responding promptly and completely to requests for documents, information, and feedback throughout the course of our representation. 

	Please do not hesitate to discuss any concerns about legal fees you may have with me now or at any time in the future— we are committed to working with you to stay within your budget.<br /><br />   

5. **Records Retention**<br />
	In order to keep costs down and reduce our environmental impact, we endeavor to maintain a “paperless” office to the greatest extent practical. To that end, we generally manage all work through the LawPal platform.  To the extent that a client-related documents are not otherwise saved onto the LawPal platform, we will upload to LawPal such client-related documents we create or that come into our possession (including without limitation notes and other attorney work product and executed final agreements). With the exception of certain documents that have intrinsic value as originals (such as stock certificates, certain government-stamped certificates, original promissory notes, and other negotiable instruments), we will usually securely shred original documents shortly after upoloading, without giving you further notice. We believe it is very unlikely that you or we will ever have need of originals destroyed in this manner. However, if you would prefer that we do not destroy any original documents, or if you would like us to preserve paper originals of specific documents, please so advise us immediately in writing and we will arrange to have them delivered to you (at your expense, if applicable) instead. By signing this letter, you consent to our destruction of originals in the foregoing manner.  <br /><br />

6. **Other Matters**<br />
	This engagement letter contains the entire agreement between the parties and shall be governed by the laws of the State of [         ]. Our relationship with you will be deemed concluded when we have completed our agreed-upon services, except that for the avoidance of doubt, your obligations for fees and charges shall survive.  In addition, and without limiting the preceding sentence, in the event we have performed no work on your behalf for twelve consecutive months, you agree that our attorney-client relationship with you will have been terminated.

	You may terminate the Firm’s representation at any time; however, you will be responsible for all costs incurred and professional fees for time spent as of the time of termination. We may likewise terminate and withdraw from our representation at any time as permitted by the applicable rules of professional conduct. You agree not to object to any such withdrawal, including withdrawal as a result of your failure to pay fees or costs incurred.

	While the subject matter of our representation and all our communications with you remain confidential, we wish to have the right, from time to time, to identify you and your business as a client of the firm, principally in online and print marketing materials. Please let me know if you do not wish to have us identify you as a client of the Firm in this or any manner.

	If the above terms are acceptable to you, please sign and date below. We are committed to being a good partner and delivering real value to you as you build and grow your business. Please do not hesitate to let me know at any time if you have any questions or if there is anything we can do to serve you better.<br /><br />


Very truly yours,
