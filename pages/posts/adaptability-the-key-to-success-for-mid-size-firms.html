The great advantage that mid-size law firms have over their larger counterparts is their ability to adapt to new technology.

This is one message from “Industry Focus: A Glass Half Full of Half Empty?”, a Peer Monitor report developed specifically to examine the unique opportunities and challenges mid-size firms will face in the near future.

Ironically, while new technology has leveled the playing field and allowed mid-size firms to “punch above their weight,” those same technology innovations have also hastend the commoditization of legal services. And, it is likely that the segment of the market to be hit first by these changes will be the mid-size firms.

Does this mean that lawyers are going to disappear? Not at all. But it is becoming increasingly clear that ongoing technology advances will significantly impact what lawyers are asked to do by their clients.

Those firms that continue to incorporate potentially field-changing technologies and remain adaptable should be well-positioned to prosper in the future. Mid-size firms can continue to maintain an advantage over their larger counterparts only if they are constantly willing to rethink the basic organizational, pricing and service delivery models that dominate the market.
